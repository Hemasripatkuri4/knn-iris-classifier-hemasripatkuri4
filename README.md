# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification on Iris Dataset

This project implements the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to classify the famous **Iris dataset**.  
It covers dataset loading, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization of results.  
Developed by **Hemasripatkuri4** as part of AI & ML Internship **Task 6**.

## 📌 Features
- Load and explore the Iris dataset.
- Scale features for improved performance.
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Experiment with multiple K values to find optimal accuracy.
- Evaluate using:
  - Accuracy score
  - Confusion matrix
  - Classification report
- Plot decision boundaries for visual understanding.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
